This is a student project meant to attempt to predict the star ratings giving by the EURO-NCAP. Due to help simplify the project, we have seperate the star ratings into 5 stars and not 5 stars. Our goal is to predict when something is or isn't five stars. Once our model is accurate enough, we can see what our model decided were important safety features when making it's predictions.
